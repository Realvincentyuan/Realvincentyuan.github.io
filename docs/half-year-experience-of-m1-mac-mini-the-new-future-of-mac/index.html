This chip was officially unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2020, and after Apple released the Macs with M1 in the fall, the Mac's sales skyrocketed in the sluggish personal computer market, with positive user feedback. With that in mind, I bought the M1 Mac with a "let's give it a try" attitude. After using it for six months, I would like to share my thoughts and experiences with all of you.</p><p>As the background of the readers may vary, I want to clarify that I am a data science professional, and my usage scenarios with Mac may differ from others. In my work, programming, using common office software, and web browsing are the primary uses of Mac. In my personal life, I also use Mac for simple graphic design, video editing, and photo editing. So, the following experiences will be shared from these perspectives.</p><h2 id="2-user-experience">2 User Experience</h2><h3 id="21-compatibilityoverall-satisfactory">2.1 Compatibility - Overall satisfactory</h3><p>I would like to start with compatibility because the M1 chip architecture has transitioned from x86 to ARM, and many people may be concerned about the compatibility of software that was previously used on Intel Macs. To address the software compatibility issue, Apple has proposed two solutions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861?ref=localhost">Rosetta 2</a>, which is prompted to install when you first install an app that is not yet translated for the ARM architecture. Rosetta 2 runs in the background and translates the app into code that can run on ARM-based Macs.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BulletTech2021/Pics/2021-6-5/1622900346241-image.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>Installing Rosetta 2, image source: Apple</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/porting-your-macos-apps-to-apple-silicon?ref=localhost">Developing universal apps with Xcode</a>. Starting from Xcode 12, developers can create universal apps that can run natively on both ARM and x86 Macs.</li></ul><p>These two solutions effectively solve the problems of x86 software compatibility and the lack of native apps. After six months of experience, the conclusion is that most commonly used apps can run smoothly, and the user experience is almost the same as that of Intel Mac. It's worth noting that M1 Mac can also run many iOS apps natively.</p><p>However, for data science professionals, the compatibility of programming environments is crucial. As of June 3, 2021, popular code editors have been natively adapted or can be installed and translated through Rosetta 2. The software itself runs fine, but the compatibility of common frameworks and packages varies. The installation and configuration process is not as smooth as on Intel Mac, and the situation is more diverse and complex. Therefore, it is recommended to search for specific tutorials. Currently, my preferred solution is to use third-party platforms like Colab for on-demand usage. It can be anticipated that the experience of installing and running frameworks and packages that update slower than Intel Mac may be compromised for a long time. Similarly, for graphic design, video editing, and photo editing work, the software itself runs fine, but the compatibility of plugins still depends on the specific situation.</p><p>For those who are sensitive to compatibility, I recommend using a very useful website to check the compatibility of apps: <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/for/m1?ref=localhost">Is Apple silicon ready?</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1862" height="1554" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-15.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-15.png 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-15.png 1600w, ../content/images/2023/06/image-15.png 1862w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Is Apple silicon ready?</figcaption></figure><h3 id="22-stability-and-scalabilitygood-as-usual">2.2 Stability and scalability - Good as usual</h3><p>Apple made significant upgrades to macOS in macOS Big Sur, reshaping the system design language, adding Control Center, and optimizing many Apple's own apps. Through multiple updates, the stability and security of M1 Mac have been gradually improving. For regular users, stability is not a concern. However, I personally have encountered an issue that has not been resolved so far: intermittent black screen on external monitors. I need to unplug and re-plug the monitor connection to resolve it; otherwise, a prolonged black screen will cause the computer to restart. There are also many users sharing stability issues online, such as difficulty in Bluetooth pairing, unstable connections, and fast SSD degradation, but I haven't personally encountered them. These issues may vary from person to person.</p><p>In terms of scalability, among the Mac models equipped with the M1 chip, Mac mini has the most and most comprehensive interfaces, while MacBook models only have two Thunderbolt 3 ports. Mac mini supports simultaneous connection to a 6K (60Hz) display and a 4K (60Hz) display. I use an LG 27UL850 monitor, and both the Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI 2.0 ports can achieve 4K (60Hz) output. Apart from the occasional black screen issue, the daily office experience is excellent. However, compared to the Intel version of Mac mini, the M1 version has two fewer Thunderbolt ports. If you need to connect more external devices and the interfaces are insufficient, you can purchase additional docking stations as needed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/image-16.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1230" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-16.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-16.png 1000w, ../content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-16.png 1600w, ../content/images/2023/06/image-16.png 2022w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ports of <em>M1 Mac mini</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id="22-performanceits-really-impressive">2.2 Performance - It's really impressive</h3><p>Conclusion: It may have better performance than 90% of computers in the same price range, and 8GB of RAM is sufficient in most cases. Many people have shared the excellent performance of the M1 chip in various usage scenarios such as code compilation, graphic design, and video editing, and I have personally found it to be true. When choosing a machine, the specifications and performance of the chip are almost the same, so many people are unsure whether to upgrade to 16GB of RAM. In my opinion, if you are unsure, it's better not to upgrade because it proves that 16GB of RAM is not a necessity. In six months of use, I have only encountered one situation where resources were insufficient: when running 4 simulators in Xcode, there was a prompt about limited resources, but the apps still ran smoothly. In other tasks, 8GB of RAM has been able to handle everything, and so far I haven't heard the fan noise from the machine.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="../content/images/2023/06/image-18.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="../content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-18.png 600w, ../content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-18.png 1000w, ../content/images/2023/06/image-18.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>M1 features</figcaption></figure><p>For most regular users, the speed of software opening, response time, and smoothness when running multiple apps are some of the most intuitive performance indicators. In these aspects, the M1 Mac outperforms most Intel Macs in a similar price range. For professional users, it will still take some time for professional software, plugins, and other dependencies to be fully compatible, so it's recommended to research and gather information based on your own needs before making a decision to purchase.</p><h3 id="24-room-for-improvement">2.4 Room for Improvement</h3><ul><li>Better iOS app adaptation: The ability of the M1 Mac to run iOS apps natively is very appealing because it can greatly enhance the software ecosystem on macOS. However, currently, the majority of apps run on Mac with the same layout as on the iPhone or iPad, without specific optimization for the desktop operating system. So far, I have only used a few iOS apps such as Gaode Maps, WeChat Read, and some apps with simple interactions.</li><li>More ports: The current M1 MacBook models only have 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, which can be limited for users who need to connect multiple external devices.</li><li>Compatibility with external devices: The stability of Bluetooth devices and external displays needs further improvement.</li></ul><p>Overall, the first Mac with a self-developed chip has exceeded the expectations of the general public. In the 2020 WWDC, Apple's CEO Tim Cook announced that Mac would complete the transition from x86 architecture to ARM architecture within two years. In reality, as of April 2021, the sales of M1 Mac have already surpassed Intel Macs[^1]. Compared to previous chip architecture transitions[^2], this time the process has been smoother, and the M1 chip has provided unprecedented driving force for the new Macs. The future looks promising!</p><h2 id="3-expectations-for-wwdc-2021">3 Expectations for WWDC 2021</h2><p>As someone with experience in iOS development, I closely follow the annual WWDC to stay updated on the latest developments. On one hand, Apple updates all its operating systems and upgrades development frameworks and tools. On the other hand, Apple has a precedent of announcing hardware at WWDC, allowing ordinary consumers to learn about new Apple hardware releases. In this section, I will share some media predictions and my own expectations for WWDC 2021 as of June 5, 2021.</p><h3 id="31-macos">3.1 macOS</h3><p>Although Apple updates all of its operating systems, this article will only discuss macOS. Currently, there is limited information about the new macOS system, so the following content is purely speculative based on previous update patterns.</p><ul><li>One of the key focuses of the new macOS update will be further strengthening the optimization for Apple Silicon Macs.</li><li>Introduce more development tools in Xcode to help developers adapt their apps to Apple Silicon Macs and accelerate the adaptation of existing Intel Mac apps.</li><li>Optimize the functionality of the Notification Center and widgets.</li><li>Enhance the design and functionality of the Control Center.</li><li>Improve the features and user experience of Apple's native apps like Mail, Messages, Photos, etc.</li><li>There might be some slight adjustments to the icon design style, with rumors suggesting a closer resemblance to the new skeuomorphic design used in iOS.</li></ul><h3 id="32-new-macs">3.2 New Macs</h3><p>There are rumors that Apple will announce new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models at WWDC 2021. The new models are expected to be equipped with the next generation of M-series chips, mini-LED displays, more than two USB-C ports, a new square-shaped design similar to the iPhone 12, a new magnetic charging connector, and traditional function keys replacing the Touch Bar. The likelihood of these predictions about new chips, displays, and more ports becoming a reality is relatively high. Overall, considering the positive reception of the M1 MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, the new models are likely to bring even better performance. If you are considering an upgrade, there is no need to hesitate!</p><h2 id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2><p>Looking back at my years of experience using Mac, I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills and have accomplished many meaningful and interesting things on my Mac. After using the M1 Mac, I can personally feel the significant boost in the Mac experience brought by the self-developed chip. Just like the significance of the A-series chips for the iPhone, the M1 chip will provide increasingly powerful momentum for Mac in the future. It can be imagined that the M1 Mac is expected to become the most popular product in the personal computer market in the near future. Let's keep our eyes open for it!</p>
