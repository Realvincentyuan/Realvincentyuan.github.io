    # Outer closure function
    count = 0
    def counter():
      # Nested function
        nonlocal count
        count += 1
        return count

    return counter
</code></pre><p>Why define functions like this - with one function inside another, and the outer function returning the inner function as its output? What are the benefits of this approach? In this article, we will uncover the mysterious veil of closures.</p><h2 id="2-key-points-of-closures">2 Key points of closures</h2><p>A closure is a function that extends the scope of a function, referring to a non-global variable (such as count in the example above) that is not defined in the function. By adding nonlocal, the variable is marked as a free variable (nonlocal keyword was added in Python 3), allowing the nested function to modify the immutable variable outside the scope.</p><p>When we call make_counter, it returns a counter function object. Each time we call the counter, it updates count, as shown below:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Run the closure function
counter = make_counter()
print(counter())
print(counter())
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">1
2
</code></pre><p>In this example, one thing that needs to be expanded is the storage location of the historical value of count. Count is a local variable in the make_counter function, and its initial value is 0. However, when counter is called, the make_counter function has already been returned, and the local scope should no longer exist.</p><p>In the counter function, count is a free variable, and the counter function implements the binding of this variable. We can check the names of stored local variables and free variables using the <strong>code</strong> attribute (which represents the compiled function definition body) in Python. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># View free variables
counter.__code__.co_freevars
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>(&apos;count&apos;,)
</code></pre><p>The binding of count is in the <strong>closure</strong> attribute of the returned counter function, where each element of <strong>closure</strong> corresponds to a name in <code>counter.__code__.co_freevars</code>. These elements are cell objects, and their stored values can be accessed through the cell_contents attribute, as shown below:</p><pre><code class="language-python">counter.__closure__[0].cell_contents
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>2
</code></pre><p>Closures can solve lightweight problems very concisely and intuitively. If we were to use a <code>class</code> to implement the functionality above, it would look like this:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Define a counter using a class, starting from 0
class Counter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.count = 0

    def __call__(self):
        self.count += 1
        return self.count

counter = Counter()
print(counter())
print(counter())
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">1
2
</code></pre><h2 id="3-summary">3 Summary</h2><p>A closure is a function that retains the binding of free variables that were present when the function was defined, so even if the scope no longer exists after the function is returned, the bindings can still be used. Closures can easily implement simple class functionality, and there are many Python &quot;magic&quot; functions that can be implemented based on this, such as decorators, which we will explore next time!</p><p>I hope this article has been helpful to you, and feel free to discuss in the comments!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Tips for Common Operations on Python Dictionaries]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2><p>In the previous article, we reviewed <a href="https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzI4Mjk3NzgxOQ%3D%3D&amp;mid=2247484437&amp;idx=1&amp;sn=6d58dbd242157e216cb0e573678686d9&amp;chksm=eb90f761dce77e7711ad25f26be3ff212d80db386a74d5902af1247e027e1108c84ec8d0fb7c&amp;token=379425388&amp;lang=zh_CN&amp;ref=localhost#rd">common operations on Python lists</a>.

As a commonly used data type, lists play a very important role in daily work. In this article, we will continue to talk about another commonly used data type in Python - dictionaries (Dict).</p><p>Dictionaries can be defined using the <code>dict()</code> method or using curly braces, such as <code>name2code = {&apos;Tony&apos;:1, &apos;Kevin&apos;:2, &apos;Luis&apos;:3}</code>. If you want to add elements, you can use the key-value assignment pattern: <code>name2code[&apos;Nick&apos;] = 0</code>. It is easy to see that, unlike lists, dictionaries do not use integers as subscripts. Let&apos;s take a look at the commonly used methods of dictionaries.</p><h2 id="2-common-dictionary-methods">2 Common Dictionary Methods</h2><h3 id="21-indexing">2.1 Indexing</h3><p>Since dictionaries are in the form of key-value pairs, you can use the key to index the value you need. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(name2code[&apos;Nick&apos;] )
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">0
</code></pre><p>Similarly to lists, you can use the <code>in</code> operator to check whether the dictionary contains the key you want to find. It is worth noting that the implementation of the <code>in</code> operator in lists and dictionaries is different. Lists use a search algorithm, so when the list becomes longer, the search time will also become longer. But dictionaries use a hash table algorithm, so regardless of how many key-value pairs there are in the dictionary, the <code>in</code> operator takes almost the same amount of time.</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(&apos;Nick&apos; in name2code)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">True
</code></pre><p>If you want to see whether a value is in the dictionary, you can use the <code>values()</code> method to extract the values from the dictionary and use the <code>in</code> operator to check:</p><pre><code class="language-python">values = name2code.values()
print(0 in values)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">True
</code></pre><h3 id="22-deleting-elements">2.2 Deleting Elements</h3><p>The method for deleting elements from a dictionary is similar to that for a list:</p><ul><li>To clear a dictionary: <code>name2code.clear()</code>, note that the <code>clear()</code> method has no return value</li><li>Remove the key-value pair associated with the key k and return the corresponding value: <code>name2code.pop(k, [default])</code></li><li>Return the last key-value pair added and remove it: <code>name2code.popitem()</code></li></ul><h3 id="23-looping">2.3 Looping</h3><p>You can use a for loop to iterate through the keys of a dictionary. Please note that because the keys are hashable, their appearance does not follow a specific order. The following code may have a different output order on your computer (Note: Python 3.6 and later versions retain the order in which the key-value pairs were added, so the result is determined):</p><pre><code class="language-python">for i in name2code:
    print(i, name2code[i])
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">Tony 1
Kevin 2
Luis 3
Nick 0
</code></pre><p>If you want to iterate through both the key and value, you can use the <code>items()</code> method:</p><pre><code class="language-python">for k,v in name2code.items():
    print(k,v)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">Tony 1
Kevin 2
Luis 3
Nick 0
</code></pre><h3 id="24-reverse-lookup">2.4 Reverse Lookup</h3><p>For a dictionary, the operation of using a key to find a value has been introduced above. If you want to use a value to find its associated key, then you need to perform a reverse lookup. Note that a <code>raise</code> statement is used here to throw an exception, which is used to display the value of the parameter being searched.</p><pre><code class="language-python">def reversed_lookup(d, v):
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == v:
            return i
    raise ValueError(&quot;The value being searched for is not in the dictionary&quot;)

reversed_lookup(name2code,5)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)
&lt;ipython-input-33-832e824fe6b4&gt; in &lt;module&gt;
----&gt; 1 reversed_lookup(name2code,5)

&lt;ipython-input-32-be75152f6e58&gt; in reversed_lookup(d, v)
      4             return i
      5
----&gt; 6     raise ValueError(&quot;The value being searched for is not in the dictionary&quot;)

ValueError: The value being searched for is not in the dictionary
</code></pre><h3 id="25-dictionary-comprehension">2.5 Dictionary Comprehension</h3><p>Starting from Python 2.7, list comprehension and generator expressions have also been ported to dictionaries. For example:</p><pre><code class="language-python">code2name = {code:name for name,code in name2code.items() if code &lt; 2}
print(code2name)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">{1: &apos;Tony&apos;, 0: &apos;Nick&apos;}
</code></pre><h2 id="3-variants-of-dictionaries">3 Variants of Dictionaries</h2><p>In addition to <code>dict</code>, there are several other mapping types in the <code>collections</code> module of the Python standard library:</p><ul><li><code>collections.OrderedDict</code>: This type keeps the order of keys when they are added, so the iteration order of keys remains consistent. Please note that if you define an ordered dictionary and do not insert any data after that, the original key-value pairs are still unordered, just like a regular dictionary.</li><li><code>collections.ChainMap</code>: This type can hold multiple different mapping objects. When a key lookup operation is performed, these objects are searched one by one until the corresponding key is found. This is commonly used for managing dictionaries that represent different scopes and contexts.</li><li><code>collections.Counter</code>: As the name suggests, this is a counter. When a key is updated, the counter is also updated. It is commonly used to count elements in a hash table or as a multiset (a set where elements occur multiple times).</li><li><code>colllections.UserDict</code>: This class is mainly used for inheritance by users. Inheriting from this class is more convenient than inheriting from <code>dict</code> because the methods of built-in types like <code>dict</code> usually ignore user-overridden methods, causing unexpected troubles, as detailed in Chapter 12 of <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/?ref=localhost">Fluent Python</a>.</li></ul><h2 id="4-summary">4 Summary</h2><p>The above knowledge points are commonly used in daily work. The following content also covers the summary of many years of practical experience of Python programmers. Let&apos;s review again:</p><ul><li>The keys of a dictionary must be hashable. This means that the hash value of an object remains unchanged during its lifetime, and the object must implement the <code>__hash__</code> method to support equality checks using the <code>__eq__</code> method.</li><li>Dictionaries consume a significant amount of memory. This is because dictionaries use hash tables, which must be sparse, resulting in low space utilization. If the data size is huge, it is recommended to use tuples or lists.</li><li>Key lookup in dictionaries is very efficient. As long as the dictionary can fit in memory, the speed of key lookup does not slow down with increasing data size. However, the fast speed comes at the cost of larger memory usage.</li><li>Adding new keys to a dictionary may change the order of existing keys. The specific reason depends on the implementation of the dictionary. It is recommended not to iterate and modify a dictionary simultaneously. It&apos;s better to divide it into two steps: iterate to find the content that needs to be modified and record it, then modify the original dictionary after iteration.</li></ul><p>While reviewing these knowledge points, I have gained new understanding and insights.

The values in the list are commonly referred to as elements, and the data type of the elements can be different. For example, <code>test_list = [0,1,1,&apos;a&apos;,&apos;b&apos;]</code> can successfully create a list.</p><p>Unlike tuples, lists are mutable sequences, so the operations available for sequences will be more flexible. Next, we will review the most commonly used operations on lists.</p><h2 id="2-common-operations-on-lists">2. Common operations on lists</h2><h3 id="21-traversal">2.1 Traversal</h3><p>Taking the list <code>people = [&apos;Adam&apos;,&apos;Nick&apos;,&apos;Tony&apos;]</code> as an example, we can use a for loop to traverse:</p><pre><code class="language-python">for i in people:
  print(i)
</code></pre><p>When updating the list, using an index to traverse will be more convenient:</p><pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(len(people)):
  people[i] += &apos;_suffix&apos;
</code></pre><h3 id="22-slicing">2.2 Slicing</h3><p>Like tuples, you can get the elements of a list by slicing (the index in Python starts from 0):</p><pre><code class="language-python">print(people[:2])
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>[&apos;Adam&apos;,&apos;Nick&apos;]
</code></pre><h3 id="23-deleting-elements">2.3 Deleting Elements</h3><p>a. The <code>pop</code> method can return the value to be deleted, and you can use an index to delete or delete the last element: <code>a = people.pop(2)</code> or <code>a = people.pop()</code>, the value of <code>a</code> will be <code>&apos;Tony&apos;</code>, and the original list will delete the corresponding element.</p><p>b. If you don&apos;t need the deleted value, <code>del</code> is a good method: <code>del people[0]</code>, then the list <code>people</code> will become <code>[&apos;Nick&apos;,&apos;Tony&apos;]</code>.</p><p>c. The <code>remove</code> method will delete the first required element in the list. For example, after the <code>test_list.remove(1)</code> operation, the list will become <code>test_list = [0,1,&apos;a&apos;,&apos;b&apos;]</code>. Note that the <code>remove</code> method does not return any value.</p><h3 id="24-interaction-between-lists-and-strings">2.4 Interaction between Lists and Strings</h3><p>Lists and strings can be flexibly converted. For example, convert a string to a list:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Convert string to list
name = &apos;Adam is very cool&apos;
name_list_1 = list(name)
print(name_list_1)

# The split method can split the string using a delimiter
name_list_2 = name.split()
print(name_list_2)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>[&apos;A&apos;, &apos;d&apos;, &apos;a&apos;, &apos;m&apos;, &apos; &apos;, &apos;i&apos;, &apos;s&apos;, &apos; &apos;, &apos;v&apos;, &apos;e&apos;, &apos;r&apos;, &apos;y&apos;, &apos; &apos;, &apos;c&apos;, &apos;o&apos;, &apos;o&apos;, &apos;l&apos;]

[&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]
</code></pre><p>Sometimes you need to merge a list into a string, the <code>join</code> method is very useful:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Join the elements in the list with spaces into a new string
print(&apos; &apos;.join([&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]))
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>&apos;Adam is very cool&apos;
</code></pre><h3 id="25-aliases-of-lists">2.5 Aliases of Lists</h3><p>This is a point that is easy to make a mistake. In the following code, two variables are exactly the same, changing one will also change the value of the other:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># alias is an alias for the list name
name = [&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]
alias = name
alias.pop()
print(name)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code class="language-python">[&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;]
</code></pre><p>Therefore, when you want to use two independent lists, try to use separate assignment statements or shallow copies:</p><pre><code class="language-python">name = [&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]

# Create a list with the same values
name_2 = [&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]
# Shallow copy
name_3 = name[:]
</code></pre><h3 id="26-list-arguments">2.6 List Arguments</h3><p>Tuples can be passed into functions as parameters using the <code>*</code> operator, and lists can also be passed as parameters to functions. At this time, the function will get a reference to the list, which means that if the function modifies the list, the original list will also be modified. The following example demonstrates this:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Define a function to delete the first element of a list
def del_head(t):
  del t[0]

name = [&apos;Adam&apos;, &apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]
del_head(name)
print(name)
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>[&apos;is&apos;, &apos;very&apos;, &apos;cool&apos;]
</code></pre><p>Parameter <code>t</code> and the variable <code>name</code> refer to the same list, so when <code>t</code> changes, <code>name</code> also changes. This knowledge point is very important. When writing functions, be very careful about whether the operation will create a new list or make changes to the original list.</p><h3 id="27-mapping-and-list-comprehensions">2.7 Mapping and List Comprehensions</h3><p>If you want to operate on a list with a function, mapping and list comprehensions are good choices. The built-in function map provided by Python takes two parameters - a mapping function and an iterable object, and returns an iterable object. The following example demonstrates this:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Return the square of the element
def square(n):
    return n*n

test_list = [1,2,4,5]
result = map(square, test_list)
print(result)
print(list(result))
</code></pre><p>Output:</p><pre><code>&lt;map object at 0x1101b9400&gt;
[1, 4, 16, 25]
</code></pre><p>You can also use list comprehensions to perform the same operation:</p><pre><code class="language-python">test_list = [1,2,4,5]

Here&apos;s a brief summary of the experience:</p><ul><li>Most list methods modify the list in place and return <code>None</code>, so it&apos;s important to choose the appropriate method and ensure the safety of variables.</li><li>There are multiple ways to achieve the same operation, and sometimes using the wrong method may not result in an error, but the result might be incorrect. Make sure to understand the differences before choosing the appropriate method.</li><li>Be cautious when using aliases for lists. It&apos;s not just lists, other data types can also have aliasing mechanisms.</li></ul><p>I hope these points have been helpful to you. Let&apos;s solidify our knowledge of lists with a LeetCode algorithm problem. Feel free to leave your answer in the comments! Next time, we&apos;ll talk about dictionaries (<code>Dict</code>).</p><p>Problem: Rotate Array</p><p>Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is a non-negative integer.

Many people are learning it. However, on the road to excellence, we must not neglect the basics, such as common data structures, syntax specifications, and best practices for programming thinking. By mastering these most fundamental things, we can easily handle the work based on them.</p><p>Let&apos;s first review and summarize the commonly used operations in Python data structures: The common data structures in Python can be collectively referred to as containers. Sequences (such as lists and tuples), mappings (such as dictionaries), and sets are the three main types of containers. Flat sequences such as str, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, and array.array are not within the scope of this article.</p><p>Here, we will start with tuples.</p><h2 id="2-tuples-are-not-just-immutable-lists">2 Tuples are not just immutable lists</h2><h3 id="21-record-function-of-tuples">2.1 Record Function of Tuples</h3><p>One of the significant differences between a tuple and a list is that it cannot be modified, but it has another function <a href="https://book.douban.com/subject/27028517/?ref=localhost">as a record for which there are no field names</a>. As the latter is often ignored, let&apos;s first look at the role of tuples as records.</p><p>A tuple can be defined using parentheses. Each element in the tuple stores the data of a field in the record, plus the position of this field. It is precisely this positional information that gives the data meaning. In the example below, the tuple is used as a record:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport, recorded in a tuple
lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)

# Information for Tokyo: city name, year, population (in millions), population change (in percentage), and area (in square kilometers), recorded in a tuple
city, year, pop, chg, area = (&apos;Tokyo&apos;, 2003, 32450, 0.66, 8014)

# A list of tuples in the form (country_code, passport_number)
traveler_ids = [(&apos;USA&apos;, &apos;31195855&apos;), (&apos;BRA&apos;, &apos;CE342567&apos;),(&apos;ESP&apos;, &apos;XDA205856&apos;)]

# During iteration, the passport variable is bound to each tuple. The % format operator can be matched to the corresponding tuple element.
for passport in sorted(traveler_ids):
  print(&apos;%s/%s&apos; % passport)
</code></pre><p>The output is:</p><pre><code>BRA/CE342567
ESP/XDA205856
USA/31195855
</code></pre><h3 id="22-tuple-unpacking">2.2 Tuple Unpacking</h3><p>The operation in the above for loop extracts the elements in the tuple, also known as tuple unpacking. Parallel assignment is an excellent application of unpacking tuples, as shown in the example below:</p><pre><code class="language-python"># Latitude and longitude of Los Angeles International Airport, recorded in a tuple
lax_coordinates = (33.9425, -118.408056)
# Unpack tuple and assign each element in the tuple to the corresponding variable
latitude, longitude = lax_coordinates
</code></pre><p>Another classic and elegant application is to swap the values of variables:</p><pre><code class="language-python">a, b = b, a
</code></pre><h3 id="23-tuples-as-function-parameters">2.3 Tuples as Function Parameters</h3><p>Use the <code>*</code> operator to unpack an iterable object as a function parameter. For example, Python&apos;s built-in function divmod takes two numeric arguments and returns the quotient and remainder. The following example uses <code>*</code> to pass the tuple to the function.</p><pre><code class="language-python">t = (20, 8)
quotient, remainder = divmod(*t)
print(quotient, remainder)
</code></pre><p>The output is:</p><pre><code>2 4
</code></pre><h3 id="24-tuples-as-function-return-values">2.4 Tuples as Function Return Values</h3><p>Some functions have multiple return values, and when they are assigned to a variable, the variable type is a tuple:</p><pre><code class="language-python">import numpy as np
arr = np.random.randint(10, size=8)

def count_sum(arr):
   count = len(arr)
   sum = arr.sum()
   return count, sum

result = count_sum(arr)
print(result)
</code></pre><p>The output is:</p><pre><code>(8, 40)
</code></pre><h3 id="25-zip-function">2.5 zip Function</h3><p>Zip is a built-in function in Python that can take two or more sequences and form a list of tuples. In Python 3, it returns an iterator, as shown below:</p><pre><code class="language-python">list_a = [1,2,3]
list_b = [&apos;a&apos;,&apos;b&apos;,&apos;c&apos;]

for i in zip(list_a, list_b):
    print(i)
</code></pre><p>The output is:</p><pre><code>(1, &apos;a&apos;)
(2, &apos;b&apos;)
(3, &apos;c&apos;)
</code></pre><h3 id="26-other-common-operations">2.6 Other Common Operations</h3><p>Tuples also support some common operations, such as for the tuple <code>a = (1, &apos;y&apos;, 5, 5, &apos;x&apos;)</code>:</p><ul><li>Indexing, such as <code>a.index(&apos;x&apos;)</code></li><li>Slicing, such as <code>a[1:4]</code></li><li>Counting, such as <code>a.count(5)</code></li><li>Sorting, such as <code>a.sort()</code></li><li>Merging tuples, such as <code>c = a + a</code></li></ul><h2 id="3-summary">3 Summary</h2><p>The above content not only covers the basic operations of tuples but also combines other functions, operators, and so on that are often used in practical work. When reviewing this knowledge, I mainly referred to two classic Python programming books: &quot;Fluent Python&quot; and &quot;Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist,&quot; and interested friends can read them in-depth!</p><p>I hope this article is helpful to you, and next time, I will summarize the tips for using Python lists.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introduction to Google Analytics]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="1-introduction">1.

For example, at BulletTech, when operating WeChat official accounts, we monitor important indicators such as traffic sources, replication, and follow-up after reading through backend data for each article. This data can help us analyze reader preferences, traffic channels, and make flexible adjustments to article themes and promotional strategies. For platforms that already have a good data analysis infrastructure, ready-made solutions can save decision makers a lot of time. But if you have built a product from scratch, how do you construct the infrastructure and strategy for data analysis? This article will take BulletTech&apos;s blog as an example to introduce how to use Google Analytics (Google Analytics) to analyze website performance.</p><h2 id="2-the-role-of-google-analytics">2. The Role of Google Analytics</h2><p>Google Analytics is a free tool released by Google for website and mobile app analysis. After Google Analytics is configured on a website, it can capture user behavior data on the website to help optimize it. Google Analytics plays an important role in the following areas of analysis:</p><ul><li>Marketing: Google Analytics can clearly show the behavior and conversion rates of users from each channel on the website, helping to optimize inferior channels.</li><li>Search Engine Optimization (SEO): Google Analytics has multiple dimensions for traffic acquisition, allowing you to see which content helps get more clicks.</li><li>Site content: Information such as which pages users stay on longest, which pages are viewed the most, which pages have the highest conversion rates, site performance, etc. can be seen in Google Analytics and are key information for optimizing content.</li></ul><h2 id="3-tips-for-using-google-analytics">3. Tips for Using Google Analytics</h2><p>Firstly, you need to configure Google Analytics for your website. Google provides a detailed <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1008015?hl=en&amp;ref=localhost">tutorial</a>, so it will not be repeated here. With a few simple steps, you can deploy a tracking ID or tracking code on your website and Google Analytics can help collect data. This data is a precious resource for analysis and decision making in the future.</p><p>Google Analytics provides many dimensions of data for users to build their own analysis reports. The Google Analytics sidebar is classified by data type:</p><ul><li>Home: Important indicators preset by Google.</li><li>Custom: User-defined reports.</li><li>Real-time: Real-time data on the site.</li><li>Audience: User profile data.</li><li>Acquisition: Traffic profile data.</li><li>Behavior: User behavior data on the site.</li><li>Conversion: Conversion data for goals and e-commerce.</li></ul><p>Basically, in each type, there is an overview and a detailed presentation of specific data details in subcategories.</p><h3 id="31-home">3.1 Home</h3><p>Home contains important indicators preset by Google for a quick overview of the site&apos;s overall performance, such as user volume, performance of various traffic sources, user geographic distribution, browsing time, most clicked pages, device type, etc. Google also provides an analysis intelligent module that can adaptively summarize insights.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BulletTech2021/Pics/2021-7-31/1627739241720-Home.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to Google Analytics" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Home</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BulletTech2021/Pics/2021-8-1/1627790805820-%E6%B4%9E%E8%A7%81.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to Google Analytics" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Google Analytics Intelligent Analysis</figcaption></figure><h3 id="32-audience">3.2 Audience</h3><p>This module is mainly used to describe user profiles, such as new and old users, geographic distribution, session performance, device type, operating system type, etc. This information helps you understand the overall situation of site users.

So, I can consider myself an experienced user. Currently, I have the M1 Mac mini (8GB RAM + 256GB SSD), which was released on November 11, 2020, and I purchased it on December 18, 2020. This machine holds special significance as it is equipped with Apple&apos;s first desktop-class chip, the M1. This chip was officially unveiled at Apple&apos;s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in 2020, and after Apple released the Macs with M1 in the fall, the Mac&apos;s sales skyrocketed in the sluggish personal computer market, with positive user feedback. With that in mind, I bought the M1 Mac with a &quot;let&apos;s give it a try&quot; attitude. After using it for six months, I would like to share my thoughts and experiences with all of you.</p><p>As the background of the readers may vary, I want to clarify that I am a data science professional, and my usage scenarios with Mac may differ from others. In my work, programming, using common office software, and web browsing are the primary uses of Mac. In my personal life, I also use Mac for simple graphic design, video editing, and photo editing. So, the following experiences will be shared from these perspectives.</p><h2 id="2-user-experience">2 User Experience</h2><h3 id="21-compatibilityoverall-satisfactory">2.1 Compatibility - Overall satisfactory</h3><p>I would like to start with compatibility because the M1 chip architecture has transitioned from x86 to ARM, and many people may be concerned about the compatibility of software that was previously used on Intel Macs. To address the software compatibility issue, Apple has proposed two solutions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211861?ref=localhost">Rosetta 2</a>, which is prompted to install when you first install an app that is not yet translated for the ARM architecture. Rosetta 2 runs in the background and translates the app into code that can run on ARM-based Macs.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/BulletTech2021/Pics/2021-6-5/1622900346241-image.png" class="kg-image" alt="Half-year Experience of M1 Mac mini - The New Future of Mac" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Installing Rosetta 2, image source: Apple</figcaption></figure><ul><li><a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple-silicon/porting-your-macos-apps-to-apple-silicon?ref=localhost">Developing universal apps with Xcode</a>. Starting from Xcode 12, developers can create universal apps that can run natively on both ARM and x86 Macs.</li></ul><p>These two solutions effectively solve the problems of x86 software compatibility and the lack of native apps. After six months of experience, the conclusion is that most commonly used apps can run smoothly, and the user experience is almost the same as that of Intel Mac. It&apos;s worth noting that M1 Mac can also run many iOS apps natively.</p><p>However, for data science professionals, the compatibility of programming environments is crucial. As of June 3, 2021, popular code editors have been natively adapted or can be installed and translated through Rosetta 2. The software itself runs fine, but the compatibility of common frameworks and packages varies. The installation and configuration process is not as smooth as on Intel Mac, and the situation is more diverse and complex. Therefore, it is recommended to search for specific tutorials. Currently, my preferred solution is to use third-party platforms like Colab for on-demand usage. It can be anticipated that the experience of installing and running frameworks and packages that update slower than Intel Mac may be compromised for a long time. Similarly, for graphic design, video editing, and photo editing work, the software itself runs fine, but the compatibility of plugins still depends on the specific situation.</p><p>For those who are sensitive to compatibility, I recommend using a very useful website to check the compatibility of apps: <a href="https://isapplesiliconready.com/for/m1?ref=localhost">Is Apple silicon ready?</a></p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-15.png" class="kg-image" alt="Half-year Experience of M1 Mac mini - The New Future of Mac" loading="lazy" width="1862" height="1554" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-15.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-15.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-15.png 1600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-15.png 1862w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Is Apple silicon ready?</figcaption></figure><h3 id="22-stability-and-scalabilitygood-as-usual">2.2 Stability and scalability - Good as usual</h3><p>Apple made significant upgrades to macOS in macOS Big Sur, reshaping the system design language, adding Control Center, and optimizing many Apple&apos;s own apps. Through multiple updates, the stability and security of M1 Mac have been gradually improving. For regular users, stability is not a concern. However, I personally have encountered an issue that has not been resolved so far: intermittent black screen on external monitors. I need to unplug and re-plug the monitor connection to resolve it; otherwise, a prolonged black screen will cause the computer to restart. There are also many users sharing stability issues online, such as difficulty in Bluetooth pairing, unstable connections, and fast SSD degradation, but I haven&apos;t personally encountered them. These issues may vary from person to person.</p><p>In terms of scalability, among the Mac models equipped with the M1 chip, Mac mini has the most and most comprehensive interfaces, while MacBook models only have two Thunderbolt 3 ports. Mac mini supports simultaneous connection to a 6K (60Hz) display and a 4K (60Hz) display. I use an LG 27UL850 monitor, and both the Thunderbolt 3 and HDMI 2.0 ports can achieve 4K (60Hz) output. Apart from the occasional black screen issue, the daily office experience is excellent. However, compared to the Intel version of Mac mini, the M1 version has two fewer Thunderbolt ports. If you need to connect more external devices and the interfaces are insufficient, you can purchase additional docking stations as needed.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-16.png" class="kg-image" alt="Half-year Experience of M1 Mac mini - The New Future of Mac" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1230" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-16.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-16.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-16.png 1600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-16.png 2022w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Ports of <em>M1 Mac mini</em></figcaption></figure><h3 id="22-performanceits-really-impressive">2.2 Performance - It&apos;s really impressive</h3><p>Conclusion: It may have better performance than 90% of computers in the same price range, and 8GB of RAM is sufficient in most cases. Many people have shared the excellent performance of the M1 chip in various usage scenarios such as code compilation, graphic design, and video editing, and I have personally found it to be true. When choosing a machine, the specifications and performance of the chip are almost the same, so many people are unsure whether to upgrade to 16GB of RAM. In my opinion, if you are unsure, it&apos;s better not to upgrade because it proves that 16GB of RAM is not a necessity. In six months of use, I have only encountered one situation where resources were insufficient: when running 4 simulators in Xcode, there was a prompt about limited resources, but the apps still ran smoothly. In other tasks, 8GB of RAM has been able to handle everything, and so far I haven&apos;t heard the fan noise from the machine.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-18.png" class="kg-image" alt="Half-year Experience of M1 Mac mini - The New Future of Mac" loading="lazy" width="1600" height="900" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-18.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-18.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-18.png 1600w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>M1 features</figcaption></figure><p>For most regular users, the speed of software opening, response time, and smoothness when running multiple apps are some of the most intuitive performance indicators. In these aspects, the M1 Mac outperforms most Intel Macs in a similar price range. For professional users, it will still take some time for professional software, plugins, and other dependencies to be fully compatible, so it&apos;s recommended to research and gather information based on your own needs before making a decision to purchase.</p><h3 id="24-room-for-improvement">2.4 Room for Improvement</h3><ul><li>Better iOS app adaptation: The ability of the M1 Mac to run iOS apps natively is very appealing because it can greatly enhance the software ecosystem on macOS. However, currently, the majority of apps run on Mac with the same layout as on the iPhone or iPad, without specific optimization for the desktop operating system. So far, I have only used a few iOS apps such as Gaode Maps, WeChat Read, and some apps with simple interactions.</li><li>More ports: The current M1 MacBook models only have 2 Thunderbolt 3 ports, which can be limited for users who need to connect multiple external devices.</li><li>Compatibility with external devices: The stability of Bluetooth devices and external displays needs further improvement.</li></ul><p>Overall, the first Mac with a self-developed chip has exceeded the expectations of the general public. In the 2020 WWDC, Apple&apos;s CEO Tim Cook announced that Mac would complete the transition from x86 architecture to ARM architecture within two years. In reality, as of April 2021, the sales of M1 Mac have already surpassed Intel Macs[^1]. Compared to previous chip architecture transitions[^2], this time the process has been smoother, and the M1 chip has provided unprecedented driving force for the new Macs. The future looks promising!</p><h2 id="3-expectations-for-wwdc-2021">3 Expectations for WWDC 2021</h2><p>As someone with experience in iOS development, I closely follow the annual WWDC to stay updated on the latest developments. On one hand, Apple updates all its operating systems and upgrades development frameworks and tools. On the other hand, Apple has a precedent of announcing hardware at WWDC, allowing ordinary consumers to learn about new Apple hardware releases. In this section, I will share some media predictions and my own expectations for WWDC 2021 as of June 5, 2021.</p><h3 id="31-macos">3.1 macOS</h3><p>Although Apple updates all of its operating systems, this article will only discuss macOS. Currently, there is limited information about the new macOS system, so the following content is purely speculative based on previous update patterns.</p><ul><li>One of the key focuses of the new macOS update will be further strengthening the optimization for Apple Silicon Macs.</li><li>Introduce more development tools in Xcode to help developers adapt their apps to Apple Silicon Macs and accelerate the adaptation of existing Intel Mac apps.</li><li>Optimize the functionality of the Notification Center and widgets.</li><li>Enhance the design and functionality of the Control Center.</li><li>Improve the features and user experience of Apple&apos;s native apps like Mail, Messages, Photos, etc.</li><li>There might be some slight adjustments to the icon design style, with rumors suggesting a closer resemblance to the new skeuomorphic design used in iOS.</li></ul><h3 id="32-new-macs">3.2 New Macs</h3><p>There are rumors that Apple will announce new 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models at WWDC 2021. The new models are expected to be equipped with the next generation of M-series chips, mini-LED displays, more than two USB-C ports, a new square-shaped design similar to the iPhone 12, a new magnetic charging connector, and traditional function keys replacing the Touch Bar. The likelihood of these predictions about new chips, displays, and more ports becoming a reality is relatively high. Overall, considering the positive reception of the M1 MacBook Air and 13-inch MacBook Pro, the new models are likely to bring even better performance. If you are considering an upgrade, there is no need to hesitate!</p><h2 id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2><p>Looking back at my years of experience using Mac, I have gained a lot of knowledge and skills and have accomplished many meaningful and interesting things on my Mac. After using the M1 Mac, I can personally feel the significant boost in the Mac experience brought by the self-developed chip. Just like the significance of the A-series chips for the iPhone, the M1 chip will provide increasingly powerful momentum for Mac in the future. It can be imagined that the M1 Mac is expected to become the most popular product in the personal computer market in the near future. Let&apos;s keep our eyes open for it!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Build a Taobao Robotic Purchasing Tool in Two Minutes]]></title><description><![CDATA[<h2 id="1-pain-points">1 Pain Points</h2><p>Major eCommerce websites offer promotional activities on specific days, such as 618 and Singles&apos; Day.

In my daily work, I also often use SnowFlake for analysis, so I have done some research on its underlying operation mechanism. Today, I will talk to you about the main architecture and working principles of SnowFlake.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/132982228-360bd20b-ed29-4ff6-84d3-c77d74169c9f.png" class="kg-image" alt="Overview of SnowFlake Architecture" loading="lazy"><figcaption>SnowFlake stock price</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2-main-features-of-snowflake">2 Main Features of SnowFlake</h2><ul><li>Security and Data Protection: SnowFlake supports multiple authentication methods, such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA), Federal Authentication, Single Sign-on (SSO), and OAuth. Communication between clients and servers is protected by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security?ref=localhost">TLS</a>.</li><li>Support Standard SQL and Many Extended SQL Features: SnowFlake supports most SQL data definition language (Data Definition Language) and data manipulation language (Data Manipulation Language), so there is no need to worry about finding corresponding operations when doing data analysis.</li><li>SnowFlake supports software clients for connection, and also provides interfaces for various programming languages such as Python connector, Spark connector, Node.js driver, .NET driver, etc.</li><li>Convenient Sharing Functionality: Users can easily share data and query statements with other users.</li></ul><h2 id="3-snowflake-architecture">3 SnowFlake Architecture</h2><p>The SnowFlake architecture combines the advantages of Shared-Disk architecture and Shared-Nothing architecture, and consists of three different layers: the Storage Layer, the Compute Layer, and the Cloud Services Layer. The architecture diagrams of these two types are shown below:</p><h3 id="31-shared-disk-architecture-diagram">3.1 Shared-Disk Architecture Diagram</h3><p>This is commonly used in traditional databases. It has a storage layer that all nodes in the cluster can access, and the computing nodes in the cluster do not have their own storage. They all access the central storage layer to retrieve data and perform processing. The cluster control software is used to monitor and manage data processing. All nodes obtain the same data, so it is absolutely forbidden for two or more nodes to update the same data at the same time.</p><p>This architecture is not conducive to performance, and lacks scalability. Applications that require frequent data updates are not suitable for this type of architecture because the Shared-Disk lock mechanism will impede them.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/132982226-1ccaf053-bddd-4c1c-933a-f555eebd1e29.png" class="kg-image" alt="Overview of SnowFlake Architecture" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Shared-Disk Architecture</figcaption></figure><h3 id="32-shared-nothing-architecture-diagram">3.2 Shared-Nothing Architecture Diagram</h3><p>As the name suggests, in the Shared-Nothing architecture, each node in the cluster has its own separate computing resources and storage space, and data can be stored in various nodes by partition. When processing user requests, the router assigns the request to the appropriate node for calculation. When a calculation error occurs, the processing process can be taken over by another node to ensure stable and correct processing of user requests. This architecture is very suitable for applications with a large amount of data reads, such as data warehouses.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/132982223-b99b67f5-3018-4f47-b03f-ac1f165f76b9.png" class="kg-image" alt="Overview of SnowFlake Architecture" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Shared-Nothing Architecture</figcaption></figure><h3 id="33-snowflake-architecture-diagram">3.3 SnowFlake Architecture Diagram</h3><p>SnowFlake uses three different layers to build the application: the storage layer, the compute layer, and the cloud services layer. The diagram is shown below:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/132982227-9cb5fbcd-cb8b-4c53-8f8d-448abddb2663.png" class="kg-image" alt="Overview of SnowFlake Architecture" loading="lazy"><figcaption>SnowFlake Architecture</figcaption></figure><p>The Storage Layer is responsible for optimizing, compressing, and storing data in multiple tiny fragments. Data is stored in row column format and managed in a manner similar to Shared-Disk. Compute nodes retrieve and process data by connecting to the Storage Layer, which is independent of other resources. SnowFlake is deployed in the cloud, so its super large distributed storage system can ensure high performance, stability, availability, capacity, and scalability.</p><p>The Compute Layer uses virtual warehouses (based on virtual machines) to run query statements. The Compute Layer and the Storage Layer are designed to be separate, and SnowFlake implements intelligent caching mechanisms between them to optimize resource utilization and reduce unnecessary interaction between the Compute Layer and the Storage Layer. Virtual warehouses come in different sizes and can be used to process requests with different performance requirements. Each virtual warehouse is independent of each other, so compute resources are not shared. The advantages of this design are:</p><ul><li>Virtual warehouses can be created or deleted at any time. It is also easy to expand the computing resources of virtual warehouses without affecting the calculation of query statements.</li><li>Virtual warehouses can be easily stopped or restarted, suitable for long periods of time without queries or need to participate in queries after a period of dormancy.</li><li>Virtual warehouse cluster size can be automatically changed very easily.</li></ul><p>The Cloud Services Layer is responsible for user information authentication, cluster management, security and encryption, metadata management of data, optimization of query statements, etc. These tasks are all completed by the Compute Layer. Common processing content examples include:</p><ul><li>User login</li><li>After the query statement is submitted, it will first go through the optimizer of the Cloud Services Layer, and then be passed to the Compute Layer for processing</li><li>Metadata required for optimizing queries and filtering data is also stored at this level</li></ul><p>The three-layer architecture of SnowFlake can be independently expanded, but SnowFlake only charges for the Storage Layer and the Compute Layer, as the Cloud Services Layer is processed in the Compute Node. The advantage of independent expansion is obvious. If more data is needed, the Storage Layer can be individually expanded. If stronger computing performance is required, the Compute Layer can be individually expanded. Refer to the official SnowFlake <a href="https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/intro-key-concepts.html?ref=localhost">Architecture Guide</a> for more details.</p><h2 id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2><p>After understanding the SnowFlake architecture, I believe you can better understand why so many companies choose SnowFlake. Its cloud-based architecture provides efficient, secure, stable, and cost-effective solutions for many enterprises. As a data analyst, I have personally experienced that SnowFlake is indeed easier to use than many traditional data warehouses.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>I hesitated for a year before writing this article.

To be honest, when I bought the Apple Watch, I had doubts for a long time because it is not an essential electronic product. Since its release in April 2015, it has been considered a flashy but impractical product by the public, including myself, and I have always been skeptical about it. However, when the Apple Watch Series 5 was released in October 2019 with the addition of the always-on display feature, it became more acceptable to the general users. So, with a mindset of giving it a try, I purchased my first Apple Watch.</p><p>After using it for over a year, I look back at the changes brought by this extraordinary watch in early 2021 and decide to share my feelings from the perspective of an ordinary user.</p><h2 id="1-design">1. Design</h2><p>The design of the Apple Watch has remained almost unchanged since its release. It initially featured a rectangular screen, and then with the release of the Apple Watch Series 4 on September 13, 2018, it introduced a rounded rectangular, almost full-screen design with rounded corners. The shape of the case has always maintained the rounded rectangular design, but Apple has differentiated the watch sizes and case materials. Taking the latest Apple Watch Series 6 as an example, the following case sizes and materials are available:</p><h3 id="11-case-sizes">1.1 Case Sizes</h3><ul><li>40mm</li><li>44mm</li></ul><h3 id="12-case-materials">1.2 Case Materials</h3><ul><li>Aluminum</li><li>Stainless Steel</li><li>Titanium</li></ul><p>If we consider the selection of watch bands, the choices become even more complex. Therefore, Apple provides the <a href="https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-watch/apple-watch?ref=localhost">Apple Watch Studio</a> to simplify the purchasing process. Users can conveniently customize their Apple Watch by selecting the case size, case material, and watch bands to create their own unique style.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-9.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="838" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-9.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-9.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-9.png 1600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-9.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Apple Watch Studio</figcaption></figure><p>It should be noted that the performance and functionality of the same generation of Apple Watch are essentially the same, regardless of the design. Therefore, when making choices based on the aforementioned design attributes, it is only necessary to select according to personal preferences. For example, I chose the 44mm Space Gray Aluminum Nike+ edition (with exclusive Nike watch faces), which is suitable for both daily work and sports scenarios. For individuals with smaller wrists, I recommend choosing the 40mm case size.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-10.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1500" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-10.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-10.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-10.png 1600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w2400/2023/06/image-10.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Wearing a 44mm Space Gray Aluminum Apple Watch</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2-features">2 Features</h2><p>Most new users are curious about what this watch can do. After more than a year of use, I have summarized the following most commonly used scenarios.</p><h3 id="21-time-display">2.1 Time Display</h3><p>Although this is the most basic function of a watch, it was not until the Apple Watch Series 5 that Apple provided a satisfactory solution. The Series 5 introduced an &quot;Always-On Retina display&quot; which means the watch can display the time at all times. Prior to this, you had to raise your wrist, tap the screen, or use the side button or crown to wake up the display, which was not always convenient. Therefore, the Always-On display is one of the biggest advantages of the Apple Watch, and it is currently available only on the newer Series 5 and Series 6 models.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-11.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy" width="2000" height="1255" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-11.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-11.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1600/2023/06/image-11.png 1600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-11.png 2326w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Always-On Retina display</figcaption></figure><h3 id="22-customizable-watch-faces">2.2 Customizable Watch Faces</h3><p>Apple and third-party app developers offer a wide variety of watch faces to choose from. Within each watch face&apos;s settings, users can add various shortcuts and complications based on their needs. I personally customize watch faces for different scenarios, such as work, fitness, and leisure, and can quickly switch between them by swiping left or right on the watch&apos;s main screen.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-12.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy" width="1170" height="2532" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-12.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w1000/2023/06/image-12.png 1000w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-12.png 1170w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Watch faces</figcaption></figure><h3 id="23-notifications-messaging">2.3 Notifications &amp; Messaging</h3><p>This was one of the primary features Apple Watch initially focused on. After pairing with an iPhone, the Apple Watch will display notifications from iPhone apps and often provide quick reply options below each notification. For example, if you receive a meeting invitation from a colleague, you can quickly tap to confirm or decline the invitation on your watch. Mature office productivity apps (like Office) and instant messaging apps (like WeChat) have implemented quick reply functionality for Apple Watch.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy" width="367" height="896"><figcaption>Notification</figcaption></figure><p>Typing on the small screen of the Apple Watch is not ideal, so if you need to input longer messages, it is recommended to use voice replies.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy" width="368" height="448"><figcaption>Reply with Apple Watch</figcaption></figure><h3 id="24-apple-pay-transit-cards">2.4 Apple Pay &amp; Transit Cards</h3><p>The Apple Watch can be used as a payment terminal for Apple Pay, allowing you to make payments using your watch. It can also be used to make payments on buses and subways using contactless card readers. Please note that a transit card cannot be used on two devices simultaneously, meaning if you want to use the same transit card on both your iPhone and Apple Watch, you need to purchase two cards.</p><p>Before purchasing, please check if Apple Pay supports the transit card for your city. As of January 1, 2021, Apple Pay&apos;s Express Transit cards are supported in 13 cities, including Shanghai Public Transportation Card, Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Interconnected Card, Xiamen eCard, Tianjin Interconnected City Card, Lingnantong&#xB7;Yangchengtong, Jiangsu Yikatong&#xB7;Changzhou, Jiangsu Public Transport One Card&#xB7;Huaihaitong, Jiangsu Yikatong&#xB7;Suzhou, Shenzhen Tong, Yanzhaotong, Jinlingtong, Chang&apos;an Tong, and Changsha Xiaoxiang Card.</p><h3 id="25-utilities">2.5 Utilities</h3><p>Unlike the feature-rich apps on the iPhone, many Apple Watch apps are designed to fulfill specific needs and have relatively focused functionality. There are several useful utilities available, such as:</p><ul><li>Stand reminders</li><li>Breathing exercises for relaxation</li><li>Noise detection</li><li>Fall detection</li><li>Find My iPhone (plays a sound on your iPhone)</li><li>Flashlight</li><li>Handwashing detection and timer (recommended for 20 seconds)</li><li>Offline playback of Apple Music songs</li><li>Control of iPhone&apos;s audio and video playback volume and song switching</li><li>Unlocking Mac</li></ul><p>These small tools have improved the overall user experience of the Apple product ecosystem in many details, and such a small computing device can change our habits of using electronic products. As a result, the positioning of the Apple Watch has gradually become clear: it is a complement to the Apple product ecosystem and focuses on fitness and health.</p><h3 id="26-fitness-and-health">2.6 Fitness and Health</h3><p>The reason why fitness and health are mentioned last is because I personally believe that it may not be the initial intention for many people to buy an Apple Watch. However, it has inadvertently become one of the most important functions of the Apple Watch.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121771894-c54a7b80-cba4-11eb-81c1-716994b53d9e.png" class="kg-image" alt="One Year Experience with Apple Watch S5 - No Regrets!" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Apple Watch Fitness and Health</figcaption></figure><p>Apple has packed many sensors into this small watch for fitness assistance:</p><ul><li>Blood oxygen sensor (exclusive to S6)</li><li>Electrode heart rate sensor</li><li>Third-generation optical heart rate sensor</li><li>Compass</li><li>Always-on altimeter</li></ul><p>It is also accompanied by many apps to help you with your workouts. During exercise, you can view real-time workout duration, energy burned, and heart rate. You can also view your fitness records in the Health app on your iPhone. Additionally, in September 2020, Apple launched the <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/09/apple-fitness-plus-a-personalized-fitness-experience-comes-to-life-with-apple-watch/?ref=localhost">Fitness+ service</a>, which aims to provide a unique personalized fitness experience and also supports the Apple Watch (not available in mainland China at the moment). These apps and services make excellent use of the wearable nature of the Apple Watch, transforming it from a nonessential product into a leading device in a specific field.</p><h2 id="3-battery-life">3 Battery Life</h2><p>The theoretical battery life of the Apple Watch is around 17 hours, and I have found that its actual performance is similar to the stated value. However, to ensure normal usage on the following day, it is recommended to fully charge the battery at the end of each day. After using it for a year, I took my watch to the Apple Store, and the Genius Bar tested the battery health, which was still around 90% of its original capacity. Therefore, there was no significant decline in actual battery life.</p><h2 id="4-buying-recommendations">4 Buying Recommendations</h2><p>In conclusion, I believe you now have a basic understanding of the role of the Apple Watch. Admittedly, it is not a product that everyone must have. However, if the aforementioned features and characteristics align with your needs, it is worth a try. Especially for those who have never purchased an Apple Watch before or those who own an S4 or earlier models, I recommend considering the S5 or newer models because they offer a significant improvement in user experience with their always-on retina display. If budget is a concern, the <a href="https://www.apple.com/apple-watch-se/?ref=localhost">Apple Watch SE</a> is a good entry-level option as it shares most of its features with the latest S6 model. For users of Apple Watch S5, upgrading may not be necessary unless you have a specific need for blood oxygen monitoring.</p><p>As a unique product, I personally recommend purchasing the Apple Care insurance service that is available for the Apple Watch. It provides coverage for up to four accidental damages within two years, and when the battery capacity drops below 80%, it offers free repair service. Due to the high integration of the Apple Watch, repairs usually involve replacing the entire device, making Apple Care a more cost-effective option compared to other products like the iPhone.</p><p>Overall, after using the Apple Watch for a year, it</p><p>has brought many changes to my usage of Apple products and has provided many new experiences. Compared to the popular iPhone, iPad, Mac, and AirPods, the Apple Watch may not be as familiar, but you cannot deny that it is indeed getting better step by step. I believe more and more people will embrace this smart device that is closest to you.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Introduction to the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro - A Promising Future]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>In March 2020, Apple quietly released the new iPad Pro on its official website, which excited many fans who had been waiting for a long time because it had been a year and a half since the last iPad Pro update.

Interestingly, this also marked the tenth year of the iPad product line.</p><p>The new model offers more features, increased storage capacity starting at 128GB, and all models come with 6GB of RAM as standard. The biggest highlight in terms of hardware is undoubtedly the introduction of the LiDAR laser sensor, which is integrated into an Apple product line for the first time, providing a strong hardware foundation for the future of AR applications. What is even more anticipated is the debut of iPadOS 13.4, which provides system-level support for mouse and trackpad for the first time. All of these hints at Apple&apos;s vision, suggesting that in the future, the iPad might indeed become the next &quot;computer&quot; for many people.</p><p>Before ordering the new iPad Pro, I owned a classic iPad Air 2, which had 2GB of RAM and the most powerful mobile chip at the time. It has been performing smoothly in most tasks with iPadOS up until today. However, compared to the new iPad Pro, its smaller screen and relatively weaker performance seem to distance it from the productivity discussions that have been ongoing. Since I often use my iPad for reading documents, writing emails, and taking notes, upgrading this time seemed like a sincere decision for someone who has been using an old device for many years. Therefore, when I saw the release of the new product, I didn&apos;t hesitate to place an order.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121772156-45251580-cba6-11eb-88ac-cba1dbb7bbbe.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro - A Promising Future" loading="lazy" width="600" height="468"><figcaption>2020 12.9 inch iPad Pro - space grey</figcaption></figure><h2 id="1-hardware-experience">1 hardware experience</h2><p>In the days of waiting for the receipt, I watched many accessories and peripherals that can be used with iPad Pro.

If the size of the font is not appropriate, you can drag the control bar in the middle to adjust the window size.Occasionally, a suspension window (as shown below) will be temporarily added. After processing, you only need to move the cursor to the right side of the screen to hide the suspension window.** The multi -tasking processing experience brought by large screen+high performance is very good. The application switching is very smooth. At the same time, 6G storage can ensure that most of the applications can be retained in the background.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121772369-984b9800-cba7-11eb-9796-9a532de1ffcb.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro - A Promising Future" loading="lazy" width="600" height="540"><figcaption>Left and Right Screen + Suspension screen</figcaption></figure><h2 id="3-peripheral">3 peripheral</h2><h3 id="31-apple-pencil">3.1 Apple Pencil</h3><p>For a person who writes code, he uses it more to record notes and write drafts.For the rest of the scene, this pen is not as useful, not a necessary accessories.However, I usually like photography and also have a certain basis for sketching, so I bought the Apple Pencil auxiliary operation, such as using a pen to repair, sketch, or make some labels.Bar.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121772397-bc0ede00-cba7-11eb-9d2b-cf06a59bcbd6.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro - A Promising Future" loading="lazy" width="600" height="540"><figcaption>Sketch Pro hand -painted work</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121772404-ca5cfa00-cba7-11eb-8d70-645892e5f6cc.jpeg" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro - A Promising Future" loading="lazy" width="600" height="540"><figcaption>AFFINITY Photo trimming</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/26101303/121772422-dea0f700-cba7-11eb-83a4-f34c97fd95dd.png" class="kg-image" alt="Introduction to the 2020 12.9-inch iPad Pro - A Promising Future" loading="lazy" width="600" height="540"><figcaption>Apple Pencil subjective evaluation</figcaption></figure><h3 id="32-xbox-one-handle">3.2 Xbox One handle</h3><p>I was a handle I bought in the Apple Store.

At the office, we use desktop computers with dual monitors, equipped with standard HP keyboards and mice. At home, I use a 13-inch MacBook Pro from 2015, and I&apos;ve been accustomed to using the built-in keyboard and trackpad of Mac, so I didn&apos;t have any additional keyboards or mice. Since I didn&apos;t spend much time using the computer at home in the past, I never thought about upgrading my computer or the accompanying devices.<br>Recently, my company arranged for remote work, and I found myself spending much more time on the computer daily. When coding on my laptop, I unconsciously leaned my head forward, which eventually led to a sore neck. To address this issue, I purchased a stand to elevate my computer, ensuring that my posture remains upright as much as possible. However, after setting up the elevated computer, I realized that using the trackpad and the built-in keyboard for an extended period caused discomfort in my wrist joints due to an unnatural position. As a result, I reluctantly started looking for a keyboard and mouse. :)</p><h2 id="device-requirements">Device Requirements</h2><p>Compared to many programmers, I am not particularly interested in mechanical keyboards, but there are a few essential requirements that the devices must meet:</p><ul><li>Keyboard layout should be macOS-friendly.</li><li>Wireless.</li><li>Convenient for multi-device switching since I often do lightweight work on my iPad.</li><li>Aesthetically pleasing.</li></ul><p>Of course, I didn&apos;t spend much time researching keyboards on the market since my primary focus was on office needs. Therefore, I narrowed down my options to Logitech keyboards. Logitech offers a wide range of keyboards, with prices ranging from 100 to over 1000, meeting the needs of most people. Since I didn&apos;t plan to upgrade my keyboard for a long time, I decided to make a one-time investment. Consequently, I looked at the keyboards in reverse order of price and two contenders stood out:</p><ul><li>Logitech Craft</li><li>Logitech MX Keys</li></ul><p>Currently, there is a price difference of &#xFFE5;100 to &#xFFE5;200 between these two keyboards on a online shopping website. Initially, I was inclined towards Craft, which was priced at 1700 when it was released in 2017. Its innovative knob looked quite appealing. In comparison, MX Keys was released in September 2019 and seemed to be a Craft without the innovative knob. Upon careful consideration, I realized that the innovative knob required additional learning and didn&apos;t offer much utility for a programmer. Moreover, the absence of the innovative knob made the MX Keys&apos; design more sleek and compact. With the backlight function enabled, the MX Keys&apos; battery life is two days longer than that of Craft, and it is also compatible with iOS and iPadOS.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="192" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/logitech-keyboard.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="389" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/logitech-keyboard.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/logitech-keyboard.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Comparison of MX Keys and Craft</figcaption></figure><h2 id="mx-keys-m720">MX Keys + M720</h2><p>If you don&apos;t particularly like the creative knob, choosing MX Keys is probably a better choice for most people. So I changed my mind and bought MX Keys for 899 yuan, plus 59 yuan for a three-year replacement plan, making a total of 958 yuan.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-1.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-1.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-1.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Logitech MX Keys inner packaging box</figcaption></figure><p>After the logistics speed basically returned to normal after the Spring Festival, I received the keyboard two days after placing the order. The packaging is decent, although I haven&apos;t bought other keyboards before, so I can&apos;t make a direct comparison. Personally, I think the packaging of MX Keys is good. Since MX Keys was released together with MX Master 3, the packaging box also explicitly recommends using it together with MX Master 3 to maximize the performance of this set of equipment. However, at that moment, I hesitated because I bought a stand for a few tens of yuan to elevate my computer, which made me feel like I had been tricked into buying a 2000-yuan keyboard and mouse. So I looked around for alternatives to MX Master 3 and watched several mouse recommendation videos from 2020. In the end, I chose the cost-effective Logitech M720 and bought it on JD.com for &#xFFE5;199. The reasons for choosing M720 are as follows:</p><ul><li>The mouse has a full and comfortable grip.</li><li>It has all the necessary function keys and good compatibility with macOS, iOS, and iPadOS.</li><li>It can quickly switch between devices.</li><li>The theoretical battery life is 2 years, and it uses replaceable AA batteries.</li><li>Cost-effective - Cost-effective - Cost-effective &#x1F642;</li></ul><h2 id="actual-experience">Actual Experience</h2><p>After setting up this keyboard and mouse, my neck and wrists no longer hurt. It has definitely improved my efficiency when using it in conjunction with my Mac and iPad.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-2.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-2.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-2.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>MX Keys and M720</figcaption></figure><p>Both MX Keys and M720 support Bluetooth connectivity for up to 3 devices. After the initial connection, you can quickly switch between devices by pressing the 1, 2, or 3 keys on the keyboard and mouse. The keyboard and mouse can also be connected to the computer using the same receiver. In actual use, I found that the device switching is almost instant, but custom settings such as mouse scrolling speed take about a second to update. As for custom functions, after downloading Logitech Options from the official website, users can customize key functions for different applications. However, the custom functions can only be selected from Logitech&apos;s preset list.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-4.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="488" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-4.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-4.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Custom settings for MX Keys</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="491" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-3.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-3.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Custom settings for M720</figcaption></figure><p>Logitech Options supports cloud synchronization of settings.

The keyboard&apos;s aesthetics are also great, and the white backlight is very useful in low-light environments. I personally like the ambient light around the keycaps &#x1F642;</p><p>MX Keys has an object detection feature. When the backlight is enabled, the keyboard automatically lights up when it detects an object approaching and turns off when the object moves away. However, when the backlight is turned on, the theoretical battery life decreases from 50 days to 7 days. After the battery is depleted, you can use the included USB-C to USB-A cable for charging. To optimize battery life, I turned off the backlight, and it doesn&apos;t affect usability in well-lit environments.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-6.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="480" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-6.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-6.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Number keys</figcaption></figure><p>As a full-sized keyboard, MX Keys has traditional function keys and a numeric keypad.

The only inconvenience is the zooming function, which is done by default by pressing Fn and dragging the mouse up or down. However, I rarely use the zoom function, so it doesn&apos;t affect my overall experience much.</p><p>On iPadOS, when using an external mouse and keyboard, the virtual keyboard will only display the currently entered content and won&apos;t cover the screen, avoiding obstructing the view.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-8.png" class="kg-image" alt="A Different Way of Working from Home - Logitech MX Keys + M720 Review" loading="lazy" width="720" height="540" srcset="realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/size/w600/2023/06/image-8.png 600w, realvincentyuan.github.io/content/images/2023/06/image-8.png 720w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Typing on iPad with an external keyboard</figcaption></figure><p>It&apos;s worth mentioning that the functional keys on the keyboard and mouse, such as switching apps, adjusting volume, and taking quick screenshots, also work.

Although I haven&apos;t experienced Logitech&apos;s promoted cross-device file transfer Flow feature, the other features and experiences are satisfying.</p><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>In summary, MX Keys + M720 is a combination of efficiency and cost-effectiveness that can fully meet daily office needs. It theoretically provides a good experience on macOS, iPadOS, iOS, and Windows. The hardware quality is reliable, and the software provides users with a certain degree of customization. At this time point in March 2020, it is still a very good choice.</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
